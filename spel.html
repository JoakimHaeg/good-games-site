<h2>Beskrivning</h2>

<p>Bloons TD 6 is a tower defense game played from a 2.5D perspective, as opposed to the 2D perspective of previous Bloons Tower Defense games,[9] and utilizes 3D computer graphics.[10]

In the game, the player—who is able to team up with up to three other players in a co-op mode[4][6]—creates a defense consisting of several variants of skilled monkeys, structures, and traps, in order to prevent balloon-like objects known as "Bloons" from reaching an exit.[11][12] Bloons TD 6 introduces a new category of monkeys, known as "heroes", which level up and become stronger either over time, or through the player using in-game currency to increase their level.[9][10] Monkeys each play a different role, and can affect Bloons in several ways, including popping them, slowing them down, or boosting the power of other monkeys.[13][14][15] When destroyed, Bloons grant the player money, which can be used to purchase additional defenses or upgrade existing ones[12][9][14]—upgraded monkeys gain access to new abilities.[16] As the player pops more Bloons each round, the player and all active towers gradually earn XP every round, which help unlock new upgrades and other features as the player continues to play the game.[17]

Bloons spawn in several waves, and travel along a predetermined path.[18][19] Sets of waves are separated into rounds, each of which consists of a set amount of Bloons, which over time become stronger and may have properties resistant to certain effects,[18][19] such as explosions, ice, or fire, with some being immune to more than one. The largest bloons are referred to as "MOAB class" bloons, which are designed as blimps and zeppelins, are harder to defeat than other bloons due to having more health than most other bloons. If a bloon gets through the player's defenses, the player loses lives, stronger bloons taking away more lives. If the player loses all their lives, the game ends. If the player can complete all the required rounds without losing all their lives, the player will win. After winning, the player has the option to exit directly back to the home screen, or go into an endless Freeplay mode, which doesn't end until the player loses. Each round is played on a specific map, and can be played on several difficulty options.[11][19][20][10] Some maps contain obstacles that will prevent monkeys from shooting at bloons in front of the offending area (some of which can be removed for a set amount of cash). </p>
